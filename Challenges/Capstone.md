## Project Requirements

- [ ] Must use **Socket.IO** on both the client and server side.
- [ ] Must contain **at least three** events that pass data back and forth between the client and the server using WebSockets.
- [ ] Must follow the [Project Structure](#directory-structure)  outlined below in this document:
	- [ ] Client-side JavaScript **must** be written in  `static/client.js`
	- [ ] Server-side JavaScript **must** be written in  `app.js`
- [ ] Project **must** implement **at least one additional pattern** we learned about in this course.
- [ ] Repository **must** contain a `README` file that contains:
	- [ ] Team members
	- [ ] App description
	- [ ] Justification for using WebSockets
	- [ ] Labeled mockup of the app **with event interaction details**
	- [ ] How to install and run the app
- [ ] Each participant must have **five or more commits** in the repository at the time of submission on Gradescope.

## Directory Structure

Please adhere to the following structure when initializing your project. This is to ensure adherence to common front-end structural best practices as well as facilitate grading.

```
ðŸ“‚ project_name
	â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ static
	    â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ client.js
	    â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ index.html
        â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ style.css
	â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ app.js
```

## Implementation Guidelines

- **KEEP IT SIMPLE**: The brevity of this starting structure should encourage your team to create a true MVP!
- **MAKE TIME FOR POLISH**: Once the app is functioning, spend the remaining time polishing it for your portfolio.
- **ASK FOR ASSISTANCE**: Schedule a [meeting with Dani](https://bit.ly/dani-meeting) if you need help with the front or back end.

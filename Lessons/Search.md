## üèÜ Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to...

- Understand how search works, and how to implement it


## [**20m**] Warm Up: Implement Pagination

Follow along with [this tutorial](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/simple-pagination-with-node-js-mongoose-and-express-4942af479ab2) and write a simple pagination implementation in a sample project.

## [**20m**] TT: Search

![autocomplete](assets/autocomplete.gif)

Think of how many websites you visit where a **Search Form** or an **Autocomplete** dropdown exists. This is a common web pattern or recipe called Simple Search.

A **Simple Search** is a search based on the text of one or a few attributes, e.g. on words in a title or body of articles or comments.

We're going to look at an implementation of Simple Search for Mongoose using Regex's. (The SQL implementation uses the SQL operator `LIKE`.)

Once we can search, we can then *paginate* the responses!

### Mongoose

![mongoose](assets/mongoose.png)

In mongoose, we can search by passing a Regex (regular expression) for the term we want to search for.

```js
User.find({ name: /john/i }, (err, docs) => { });
```

Remember to use the `RegExp` object in JavaScript to turn a string into a Regex pattern.

```js
regex = new RegExp(`/${req.query.term}/i`);
User.find({ name: regex }, (err, docs) => { });
```

## [**30m**] Activity: RegEx Challenges

![regex](assets/regex.jpeg)

Need a refresher? Read up on [this guide to RegEx](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-and-simple-guide-to-javascript-regular-expressions-48b46a68df29/), and then write RegExs for the following:

1. Return anything that has the letter "x"
1. Return anything that contains "ar"

**Stretch Challenges**

1. Return anything that starts with "the"
1. Return anything that ends with "ed"


Make sure to run it against test inputs!
